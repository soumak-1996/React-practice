EPISODE 2 Notes:-

package.json is a configuration file for npm
npm does not stand for node package manager
npm is used to manage packages but it does not stand for node package manager
npm init is used to add npm to application. and npm init will create the package.json file.

A bundler helps to clean and minify the code to make it ready for production deployment. 
npm create react uses webpack as a bundler by default

There are two types of dependencies :
1. Dev dependency. -- Only used in development environments. -D tells the npm that its a dev dependency
2. Normal dependency -- Used in all environments including production.

If there is a minor upgrade in any dependency and we use "^" the dependency will automatically be upgraded.
whereas if we use "~" it will upgrade with every major upgrade. Hence it is safer to use caret coz in case 
of major upgrade a lot of things can break in the application.

package.json keeps the approx version of every dependency and package-lock.json keeps the track of the exact
version of every dependency in the application.

Node_modules contains data and source of all dependencies in the application. package.json is the configuration
file while Node_modules is the database.

Transitive dependency :- When one dependency has dependency on other packages.

If we put package.json and package-lock.json we can create all of the node_modules so we don't need to put node_modules in github.

npx is used to execute a package and npm is used to manage packages/dependencies.

using react with cdn links needs a crossorigin import which is a costly and time consuming operation. so using react with npm is better
coz we can use it from node_modules.

import react from "react --- this react refers the react in node_modules".

Functions of parcel :-
1. Dev build.
2. Creating a local server to host app.
3. Perform HMR -- Hot Module replacement.
4. Gives faster development experience using caching.
5. Image Optimization.
6. Minification and Bundling and Compress the files for production deployment.
7. Content Hashing.
8. Code splitting.
9. Differential Bundling -- support older browsers.
10. Diagnostic and gives better error suggestions.
11. Way to host on https.
12. Tree shaking -- remove unused code.
13. Creates a different build for Dev and Production.

Parcel uses a file changing algorithm built using c++
